Quantvesting is a framework to create wealth in stock market using Quants.

Investors grow with decent businesses, traders believe in buying low and selling high.

With the help of Quants, we try to buy decent businesses when they are cheap (valuation-wise) and sell them when the become expensive).

Basically, the approach is similar to Techno-Funda investing, its just that we are using maths and technology for analysis and automation.

We build and refine our stock universe based on business fundmentals and trade in them based on technicals.

Our stock universe is categorized in criterias like: X40, X40N, X5K, X-LC, H-LC, X-MC and X-SC etc.

Our trading (buy/sell) levels are decided based on factors like: price deviation from 200 DMA, valuation deviation from 5-year median, sales and profit growth, market-cap, ROE% etc.

We will explain the acronyms used above in detail when we deep dive.

Quantvesting methodology involves a funnel of analysis: 
Macro > Industry > Business > Fundamentals > Technicals > Valuations > Technicals
