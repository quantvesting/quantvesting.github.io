## A Peaceful Way to Invest Using Quants
Investors build wealth through strong businesses.
Traders look to buy low and sell high.

At Quantvesting, we combine the best of both worlds—using the power of quants, technology, and data to identify quality businesses that are also value opportunities.

### Our goal?
Buy decent businesses when they’re cheap* and sell when they get expensive* —
*(cheap and expensive = valuation-wise).

It’s like Techno-Funda investing, but with a modern twist:
We bring in math, logic, and automation to remove noise and improve decision-making.

### How It Works
We maintain and refine a focused stock universe, based on business fundamentals, and make trading decisions based on key technical and valuation factors.

We categorize our universe into custom-built segments like:
X40, X40N, X5K, X-LC, H-LC, X-MC, X-SC
(Don’t worry—we break these down in our detailed blogs.)

Our trading signals are based on a blend of:

- Price deviation from 200/50 DMA
- Valuation gap vs 5-year median
- Sales & profit growth
- Market cap tiers
- ROE and other quality metrics

We look at the full picture—top-down:
Macro > Industry > Business > Fundamentals > Valuations > Technicals

### The Takeaway
Quantvesting isn't about chasing fads.
It's a systematic, research-backed framework designed to create long-term wealth using logic, discipline, and data.
